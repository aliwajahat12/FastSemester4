6): Obtain CFG for the language

```
a): L(G) = { w | w ϵ {a, b}*, na (w) = nb (w)}
b): L(G) = { w | w ϵ {a, b}*, na (w) = 2 nb (w)}
c): L(G) = { w | w ϵ {a, b}*, na (w) = 3 nb (w)}
d): L(G) = { x | x ϵ {0, 1}*, x starts and ends with different symbols}
e): L(G) = { x | x ϵ {0, 1}*,symbol at position i is same as symbol at position i+2 and |x| >= 2}
f): L(G) = {All non palindromes overs {0,1}*}
g): L(G) = { 0i1j2k | j > i + k }
h): L(G) = { ai bi ci | i >= 1 }
```
